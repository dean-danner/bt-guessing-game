# Binary Tree Animal Guessing Game

This project is a simple binary tree animal guessing game made in Java. The game starts off by asking the user the base or "root" question. If the root question is not the user's chosen animal then it asks them what their animal actually was and a characteristic of that animal. This can go on for awhile. The questions and answers entered by the user, along with the position in the binary tree is then saved to "answers.txt". Whenever the program is run it will load this file. Therefore, the more a user plays the game the better the game will get at guessing animals.
